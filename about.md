### Some additional words...

As a Senior C++ Software Engineer based in Malta, I bring over nine years of experience in C++ programming and software testing, primarily within the Automotive sector. I hold a Ph.D. in Information Engineering, which has provided me with a strong foundation in complex problem-solving and an analytical mindset.

My technical expertise spans C++11/14/17 (with ongoing study in C++20/23) and extensive experience with Test and Mocking Frameworks like Boost, Turtle, and Google. I'm also studying Golang. I'm a versatile professional, equally effective as a team player and an independent contributor, always customer-oriented, and driven by a passion for technological advancement and continuous learning.

In my most recent role as a Senior Software Engineer at Invicti, a leading company in Malta, I focused on enhancing backend security and authentication, implementing solutions in C++ and Node.js within a CI/CD environment utilizing Docker and GitLab. Before that, as a Senior C++ Developer at Ascent Software, another prominent company also in Malta, I was deeply involved in configuring and testing automotive hardware, refining requirements, mentoring team members, and ensuring code quality through SOLID principles and rigorous code reviews.

My academic background includes significant research in optimizing photovoltaic systems, leading to patented algorithms for enhancing power generation and detecting shadowing conditions. I also have practical experience with web technologies, developing and securing WordPress sites, and creating custom plugins.

Outside of my professional life, I'm a C++ blogger, dedicated to fostering a community of developers keen on coding challenges and algorithmic problem-solving.

I am always eager to connect with fellow professionals and explore opportunities where my skills as a C++ Software Engineer can contribute to innovative solutions, particularly within the vibrant tech landscape of Malta.
