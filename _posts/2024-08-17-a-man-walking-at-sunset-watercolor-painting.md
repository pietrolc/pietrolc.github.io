## A man walking at sunset

‚ÄúA Man Walking at Sunset‚Äù is my first watercolor painting, created with professional colors and paper. Creating this artwork was a one-of-a-kind experience: it portrays the quiet beauty of a sunset, when the sky is blazing with hues and a solitary figure wanders along a tranquil road. Which emotions do you have when you look at this man walking alone? Peace, loneliness, or introspection?

### No reference photo, just my imagination‚Ä¶

I did not utilize a reference photo. As a result, I‚Äôve decided to utilize specific colors and approaches based only on my expertise and creativity. I merely designed the structure of this painting, not bothering about the end result. I was just letting the brush move across the paper.

### Materials and Techniques

I used high-quality materials for this watercolor, with **[Fabriano](https://fabriano.com/) 300gr/m^2** (140 lbs) paper measuring 5 x 7 inches. I used **[Winsor &amp; Newton](https://www.winsornewton.com)** paints and brushes. Actually, I used three synthetic round brushes from ArtWay too (for instance, numbers 2 and 5).  
The key to painting sunsets is to employ values effectively; I discovered that the darkest portions must be dark enough to draw attention to the lighter areas. This notion inspired my technique, as I layered colors from light to dark, beginning with the softest yellows and eventually progressing to darker oranges and purples.

I started by soaking the paper, which helped the colors blend smoothly. I washed the brightest part of the sunset with cadmium yellow and cadmium orange. This layering method not only produced a colorful sky, but it also reflected sunlight on the water, increasing the overall luminosity of the picture.

### Challenges and Learning

As a beginner, I struggled to achieve the proper color balance while preserving the fluidity of the watercolors. I discovered the value of patience; waiting each layer to dry before adding fresh colors was critical to avoiding unwanted blending. I also practiced ways for producing pink and purple zones in the clouds, which gave authenticity to the composition.

### Conclusion

Completing ‚ÄúA Man Walking at Sunset‚Äù was a journey of self-discovery and learning. This painting represents my debut into the world of watercolor, capturing a brief moment that reflects my deep passion for nature and solitude. As I continue to explore this medium, I hope to improve my talents and express my artistic vision in future works.
